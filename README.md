# StarDustClicker - Our first Project @Wild Code School

This is an original version of the famous "Cookie Clicker"

The original game can be found at http://orteil.dashnet.org/cookieclicker/

# OUR TASKS
In 2 weeks we had to  : 

- Design a wireframe of the website, one for the mobilefirst version and one for teh Desktop version
- Build a responsive website structure with HTLM, CSS and VanillaJS , compliant with W3C standards
- Work on branches and create pull requests

# GOAL 
The goal of the game is to produce as many stardust as you can.
You can just click on the rocket but also buy "Boosters" that increases the amount of stardust even faster. 

Once you reach a certain level of Star Dust you unlock automatically Trophies (planets to visit in our game).
